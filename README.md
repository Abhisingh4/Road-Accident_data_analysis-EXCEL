# Overview
This project focuses on analyzing road accident data using a dataset provided by Kaggle. The objective is to gain insights into road safety by leveraging data analysis techniques and presenting the findings through an interactive Excel dashboard.

# Data Source
The road accident data used for this project is sourced from Kaggle. The dataset provides comprehensive information on accidents, including factors such as location, date, vehicles involved, casualties, and more.

# Methodology
To analyze the road accident data, the project employed time series analysis techniques to compare the frequency and severity of accidents between the years 2021 and 2022. This approach allowed for the identification of trends and patterns over time, highlighting the areas that require special attention.

# Key InSights
ðŸ”¹ The number of accidents in 2022 decreased by 11.7% compared to 2021.

ðŸ”¹ Fatal casualties dropped by 33.3% in 2022, indicating positive road safety measures.

ðŸ”¹ Serious and minor casualties also decreased by 16.2% and 10.6% respectively in 2022.

ðŸ”¹Cars, vans, and bikes were identified as the primary vehicles involved in major casualties.

ðŸ”¹The accidents are maximum on the single carriageway road type, followed by Dual Carriage Way.

ðŸ”¹ Majority of casualties (73.84%) occurred in daylight, while 26.16% happened in the dark.


ðŸ”¹Urban areas accounted for 61.95% of casualties, while rural areas contributed to 38.05%.

# Interactive Excel Dashboard
The project includes an interactive Excel dashboard that serves as a comprehensive visualization tool for the analyzed road accident data. The dashboard allows users to explore the data, filter information based on various parameters, and interactively examine the trends and patterns identified during the analysis.
